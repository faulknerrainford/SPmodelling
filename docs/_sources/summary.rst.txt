Summary
=======

The SPmodelling package is the Simulation framework for NetSim modelling.
It is in development. At this time it is implemented to allow for physical movement environments and agents and
social networks.

This framework is used to implement a model of falls in those with declining mobility:

SPmodelling can be used to build and run a model. Subclasses are created for nodes, agents, monitors and intervenors
for a specific model and then the model can be run with parrallel threading using SPm.py.
