Summary
=======

The SPmodelling package is the Simulation framework for NetSim modelling. Which has been developed with funding from the
University of Hull Business School by Yasmin Merali, Penelope Faulkner Rainford and Susan Stepney.
It is in development. At this time it is implemented to allow for physical movement environments and agents and
social networks with clustering.

This framework is used to implement a model of falls in those with declining mobility:

SPmodelling can be used to build and run a model. Subclasses are created for nodes, agents, monitors and intervenors
for a specific model and then the model can be run with distributed processes using SPm.py.
